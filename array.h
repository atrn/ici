/*
 * The ICI array object. Array objects are implemented in a manner to
 * make them efficient to use as stacks. And they are used that way in the
 * execution engine. A single contiguous array of object pointers is
 * associated with the array. a_base points to its start, a_limit one
 * past its end and a_bot and a_top somewhere in the middle.
 *
 * In the general case, arrays are growable circular buffers (queues). Thus
 * allowing efficient addition and removal from both ends. However, their
 * use in the internals of the execution engine is only as stacks. For
 * efficiency, we desire to be able to ensure that there is some amount of
 * contiguous space available on a stack by just making a single efficient
 * check.
 *
 * This is easy if they really are stacks, and the bottom is always anchored
 * to the start of allocation. (See Case 1 below.) This condition will
 * be true if *no* pop_front() or push_front() operations have been done on the array.
 * Thus we conceptually consider arrays to have two forms. Ones that are
 * stacks (never had pop_front() or push_front() done) and ones that are queues
 * (may, possibly, have had pop_front() or push_front() done).
 *
 * Now, if an array is still a stack, you can use the member function:
 *
 *     a->push_check(n)
 *
 * to ensure that there are n spaces or objects available, then just
 * increment/decrement a_top as you push and pop things on the stack.
 * Basically you can assume that object pointers and empty slots are
 * contiguous around a_top.
 *
 * But, if you can not guarantee (by context) that the array is a stack,
 * you can only push_back, pop, push_front or rpop single object pointers at a time.
 * Basically, the end you are dealing with may be near the wrap point of
 * the circular buffer.
 *
 * Case 1: Pure stack. Only ever been push_back()ed and pop_back()ed.
 *   ooooooooooooooooooooo.....................
 *   ^a_base              ^a_top               ^a_limit
 *   ^a_bot
 *
 * Case 2: Queue. push_front() and/or pop_front()s have been done.
 *   ..........ooooooooooooooooooo.............
 *   ^a_base   ^a_bot             ^a_top       ^a_limit
 *
 * Case 3: Queue that has wrapped.
 *   oooooooooooooo.................ooooooooooo
 *   ^a_base       ^a_top           ^a_bot     ^a_limit
 *
 * A data structure such as this should really use an integer count
 * to indicate how many used elements there are. By using pure pointers
 * we have to keep one empty slot so we don't find ourselves unable
 * to distinguish full from empty (a_top == a_bot). But by using simple
 * pointers, only a_top needs to change as we push and pop elements.
 * If a_top == a_bot, the array is empty.
 *
 * Note that one must never take the atomic form of a stack, and
 * assume the result is still a stack.
