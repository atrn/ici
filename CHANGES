Major Changes in Version 5

*     mapf renamed to transform. A far better name.
      Transforms an aggregate by passing its values
      through a function.

*     unique() function which returns the unique
      elements of an array

*     error is now per-exec (thread)

*     the map returned from calendar() now includes
      a "nanos" field with the nanoseconds portion
      of a floating point time (as returned from now()).

*     now() is now implemented via C++11 <chrono>
      and returns times with nanosecond precision
      in double precision floats.

*     Define split() as a synonym for gettokens().
      The name is chosen as it complements join()
      and even round-trips, i.e. given some array
      of strings, split(join(a)) == a is true.

*     Added new member functions to ici::type to allow
      the keys() builtin function to be type-generic
      and work with user-defined types.

      ici::type gets the member functions, nkeys() and keys().
      nkeys() returns the number of keys in a value and
      keys copies them to an array.  The types.h header's
      comments provide further details.

*     add round() function

*     o_debug is now called 'debugger', a pointer to
      an instance of an ici::debugger

*     Added join() to turn arrays into strings, a la
      implode, but takes a separator which defaults
      to a single space if not given.

*     ICI now has a reasonable start to an interactive
      "REPL" like interface.  Now, when started without
      arguments, instead of issuing an error message
      and exiting the REPL runs. It issues a prompt
      and parses stdin. The REPL provides some "dot"
      commands recognized at the start of an input
      line.
      Presently these are, ".r" to read a file, ".p"
      to print the value of an expression, ".h" to
      get some basic help and ".q" to quit.  Its
      very retro and simple. There is no history,
      or editing above what your system provides.

      The REPL is implemented as a special type of
      file with one "hook" in the interpreter to
      tell the REPL when a new statement is being
      parsed.

*     len() is now implemented via a per-type len()
      function. This lets new types work with len()
      (in addition to forall).

*     Undo the rename of 'extern' to 'export',
      'extern' works well and the arguments against
      it vs those for 'static' and 'auto' are
      weaker.

*     Added println "core" function (ici-core7.ici)
      and changed existing print function to not
      append a newline.

*     Rename 'path' -> 'icipath' which (a) avoids a
      all to common name and maps directly to the
      environment variable used to initialize it.

*     The arguments to the save() function are now
      swapped. The object to be saved (serialized)
      is now always first. A file, if specified,
      must be second and any scope a third argument.
      This makes the usage far clearer. It is always
      "save(object, file)" or just "save(object)" for
      some uses.

*     new core function "closure"

      The closure() function binds a function along with
      a number of arguments and returns an object that
      can be be called at a later time to call the bound
      function with those arguments.

      The function is implemented by creating an instance
      of a class that holds references to the function and
      its bound arguments. The closure() function returns a
      method of this class which may be called to "invoke"
      the bound function.

      Partial closure is supported by the fact that any
      arguments passed to the "closed" object when it is
      called are appened to the arguments "bound" when
      the object was created.

*     serialization works

      It was broken by the half-baked integration and conversion
      from module to core type opertion. Now it isn't broken and
      save and restore work.

*     better channel type support

      channels may now be closed. The semantics are similar to
      go. Sending on a closed channel does nothing, receiving
      receives NULL and channels may only be closed once.

      forall now works with channels and terminates when the
      channel is closed if not exited previously.

*    'ici_int' has been renamed 'integer'

     The "ici_" prefix is to avoid the keyword but is a
     little ugly with the use of a namespace. The new
     name is the same length.

*    'struct' has been renamed 'map'

     ICI previously re-used C's 'struct' keyword as the name
     of its dictionary type. I've renamed it 'map'. It's
     shorter and a slightly better term for what the
     structure actually is.

*    ftype's are now C++ classes. Previously ICI implemented
     its own vtable-like structure for file access types. Now
     this is done using a C++ class with virtual functions.

*    threads are now implemented using the C++ standard library
     and are now standard since we rely upon a C++ versions where
     thread support is standard.

*    ICI int types are now defined to be 64-bits and are
     not necessarily the same as C's 'long int'.

*    ICI is now (re-)implemented in C++, C++11/14 to be precise.

     C++ features are used somewhat sparingly (ahem) and the overall
     program structure remains largely the same. But there are many,
     many changes in how ICI is expressed.

     The ici_obj_t object header structure is now the base class,
     'ici::object'. All objects derive from ici::object and add
     per-type state as required. ICI objects do NOT use C++ virtual
     functions and uses an explicit 'tcode' based type lookup.

     The ici::object class provides numerous inline functions to
     manipulate the object which replace the suite of macros used in
     the C implementation. The, unverified, assumption is that today's
     advanced C++ compilers will optimize these.  A major benefit of
     having ICI objects values inherit ici::object is to eliminate
     many type casts - an ici::T is-a ici::object.

     ICI types themselves are now defined by C++ classes that derive
     from an 'ici::type' class.  The ici::type class uses virtual
     functions and is intended to be used to derive specific type
     classes.  The ici::type base class provides the default
     implementations of the type-specific operations performed upon
     ICI objects.

*    ICI signals are now enabled by default.

*    added channel module to core, converting class-based
     approach to a function-based interface.

*    renamed existng put() builtin to puts()

*    removed tracing, it was never used and is better done
     via an improved debugging interface. I wrote it. Its
     not good enough. I'll kill it.

*    merged the clib.c source into cfunc.c

*    the forall statement implementation now uses a per-type
     'step' function which opens the way for iteration over
     used-defined types.

*    include() removed, its pretty useless

*    many default sizes increased by factors of four or more
     to account for substantially more memory available on
     most modern systems. Start up time slowed a little due
     to "small int" creation but even slow CPUs are fast
     these days.

*    various modules incorporated as standard "things",

        sys     POSIX system calls
        net     BSD sockets
        str     string functions
        path    path manipulation

*    reclaim function enabled by default (forces a GC)

*    dynamic module loading no longer looks for ici3 prefixed modules

*    object serailization module integrated into core
     adding the save/restore functions and the archive
     type to the basic interpreter.

*    ft_putch removed from ici_ftype

*    Version 5 shoule be considered as a new language with the same
     structure as the previous versions of ICI.  Version 5 changes
     some keywords and purposefully breaks compatibility with programs
     written for previous versions of the language.

     Keyword Changes

        extern	 ->	export
        static	 ->	local
        auto	 ->	var

     Standard Function Changes

        thread() ->	go()
        nels()	 ->	len()

    Configuaration Changes

    Support for many older UNIX systems has been removed. These days
    UNIX means Mac OS, Linux, BSD, and, perhaps, Solaris.



Bug fixes

Changes in version 4.2

*    The struct returned by calendar() now includes an additional
     two members that provide timezone information.  The key
     "zone" references a string that is the timezone abbreviation
     and the member "gmtoff" references an integer that is the
     number of seconds offset from UTC.

*    Introduced config-related macro ICI_HAS_BSD_STRUCT_TM which
     indicates if the platform has the BSD-additions to struct tm
     that define the timezone name and offset from UTC.  If this
     is not set a function, ici_set_timezone_vals(), is used to
     add the members "zone" and "gmtoff" to the struct returned
     by calendar (see above).

*    seek()'s `whence' parameter is now optional.  If not specified
     it defaults to 0 aka SEEK_SET.  This leads to fairly natural
     looking code of the form, seek(file, position).

*    The result of the respondsto() standard method has been changed
     to return either the method resulting from the lookup or NULL
     if the lookup failed.   Code that used respondsto() in a "simple'
     fashion will still work as expected, since NULL compares as false.
     Code that relied on the zero or one result will need to be changed.

     This change permits the following code to work...

        if (method := instance:respondsto(method_name))
            call(method, arguments);

*    ici_new_src() renamed to ici_src_new() and exposed in the API.

*    Makefile.osx64 provided which builds a 64-bit enabled ICI for OS X

*    ungetchar() function added that mimics the C library ungetc

*    A working XCode project may be found in the macosx
     directory.  This project builds two targets - the dynamic
     library and the executable that uses the library. The
     project also uses a "run script" build phase to generate
     the ici.h file in a similar manner to the makefiles.

     Note that the project was created with XCode 2 on
     Mac OS X.4 (aka Tiger).

     The build creates "universal" binaries for PowerPC
     and Intel Macs.

*    It is now possible to trap calls of unknown methods.  If
     a method call is attempted and the target function is not
     found a call is made to the method "unknown_method"
     passing the name of the unfound function as the first
     argument and an array containing the actual arguments.
     Classes may provide an implementation of this function and
     do whatever they wish to do to handle the situation.
     A default "unknown_method" method is also provided
     which simply raises an error rather than the previous
     error about attempting to a call a NULL.

     The motivation for the unknown_method method is
     simplfied handling of RPC protocols such XML/RPC
     who's methods can be handled generically.

*    Extended variables automatically created within an error
     catcher.  In addition to the error string, error, there
     is now the line number and filename of the location,
     these are made avaiable in the variables errorline and
     errorfile respectively.

*    Fetching a file's name, by indexing a file with the key
     "name", no longer fails if the file has no assigned name.
     Instead of raising an error NULL is returned.

*    The keys() function may be applied to a set and returns
     an array containing the elements in the set.

*    Source code structure changes.  Makefiles moved to the
     new "Makefiles" directory, configuration headers moved
     to the new "conf" directory and the leading "conf-"
     prefix removed so their names are now of the form
     "conf/xyz.h".

*    New internal ici_set_error() function that formats a
     message into the global buffer and points ici_error
     to it.  This reduces the amount of repetitive code
     with a slight loss in performance for simple error
     strings and the introduction of a maximum length for
     error strings.

*    Added new function for generating incorrect argument count
     errors messages for intrinsic functions with a variable
     number of arguments. The new function, ici_argcount2().
     is similar to the existing ici_argcount() function but is
     generates a message specifying the minimim and maximum
     number of arguments.

*    Correct error handling for POSIX threads based threading.

*    Fixed a long standing bug that did not diagnose assignments
     to things that weren't lvalues.

*    "true" and "false" make a re-appearance.  This time. however,
     they are not pre-defined variables but keywords that evaluate
     to integers one and zero respectively.

*    Objects may be inserted into a set using the "+=" operator
     and removed from sets using the "-=" operator.

     The expression "set += any" inserts (assigns) `any' into the
     set and returns the set.

     Note that it is not possible to insert or remove sets from
     sets as the expressions "set += set" means set union and
     "set -= set" means difference.

*    The behavior of the two argument form of the assign() function
     when applied to a set has been radically changed and is now
     the opposite of its previous definition.

     When calling assign() with a set as the aggregate and only a
     key specified then the default is now to use 1 as the key and
     therefore insert the value of the key into the set.  Previously
     such a call would be equivalent to assign(set, key, NULL) and
     remove the key from the set.

     The nicer user interface afforded by the syntax "assign(a_set, any)"
     is seen to far outweigh the irregularity.

*   All symbols, regardless of type, start with either a "ici_" or
    "ICI_" prefix (uppercase used for macros). In addition a number
    of extra symbols are now exported from the interpreter's core
    to assist in writing modules that need deeper access into the
    interpreter, e.g. the object archiving module.

*   BSD and Solaris builds now use a shared library for the interpreter
    core similar to the Windows and Mac OS X builds.  A new makefile,
    Makefile.bsd-static, builds a statically linked interpreter.

*   New parseopen() function that takes a file and returns a "parseable
    file" that may be used with the parsing related functions parsetoken(),
    rejecttoken(), et al.  This is an alternative to defining parser
    functions within classes.

*   New core functions (implemented in ICI and automatically loaded
    via the icicore mechanism)

        apply       Apply a function to the elements contained within
                    an aggregate.
        map         Transform an aggregate by calling a function upon
                    its elements, adding the result of that call to
                    an aggreate of the same type which is then returned.
        walk        Traverse a directory hierarchy calling functions for
                    the files and/or directories within the hierarchy.
        memoize	    A call() variant that remembers previous results
                    and returns them when arguments are identical.
        memoized    Takes a function and returns a new function that
                    memoize's the result of that function.
        deepatom    As per atom() but applied "deeply"
        deepcopy    As per copy() but applied "deeply"
        print	    Writes a textual representation of an arbitrary
                    object to a file.

*   Added support for truncate() on Win32. (richard)

*   Mac OS X build uses pre-compiled header file built from fwd.h.
    This is removed upon a "make clobber". (andy)

*   Mac OS X version now builds as a dynamic library with the main
    interpreter program linked against that library. (andy)

*   Parser now detects when a 'break' or 'continue' statement is
    used outside of a context in which they are permitted. (andy)

*   Fixed several accesses to ici_buf and ici_error while the mutex
    is released, that occur when closing files and pipes. (richard)

*   Registered mutable string buffers with the garbage collector.
    Previously they were never freed.  Also fixed the calculation of
    memory consumption by mutable string buffers. (richard)

*   Added flags controlling I/O behaviour to ici_ftype_t. Currently
    the only flag defined is FT_NOMUTEX, which causes ICI to release
    the mutex during I/O on the file. Previously this was always the
    case, but I/O on mutable string buffers accesses ICI data so the
    mutex must NOT be released. (richard)

*   Allowed modes "r+" and "r+b" to be passed to sopen() and mopen(),
    giving stream-based read/write access to mutable strings and mem
    objects. Added the new function ici_open_charbuf() to support this.
    ici_sopen() is now a macro that uses ici_open_charbuf(). Being able
    to write formatted output to a mutable string could remove the need
    for temp files in many situations. (richard)

*   Corrected error in parser that caused a crash if a default
    or case label was at the very end of the switch block and
    had no statement after it. This fix also corrects the mis-reporting
    of line numbers on the first statement after a case or default
    label. (timl)

*   Added initialisation of two double values in f_math which in
    some circumstances (calls to single argument math functions)
    were not initilised, but then were moved. This was seen to
    cause (rare) floating point exceptions under Win95. (timl)

Changes in version 4.1.0 (a beta release)

*   Mac OS X ICI now supports threading using a minimal
    implementation of pthreads semaphores to avoid problems
    with the native Mac OS X pthreads. (andy)

*   Small fix for MacOSX from Albert Chang at Canon incoporated
    to allow building without the dlcompat library. (andy)

*   Unix systems now look in the current directory for modules
    to be more like the Win32 ici. (andy)

*   Added indexing of file object by 'name' to obtain the diagnostic
    name associated with the file object when it was created.
    Also, for the special files associated with an ICI parse stream
    (as returned by currentfile()), the index 'line' returns the
    current line number parseing has reached. This allows proper
    diagnostics in user-parsed literals. (timl)

*   Added new function 'which()', which returns which object in
    a super chain a given name is first found in (default the
    current scope.) (timl)

*   Corrected pointer calls so NULL@xxx() won't crash. (timl)

*   Made the semicolon that terminates an expression statement
    optional when followed by either } or EOF. This is mainly so
    short expressions that are evaluated in strings don't need
    a semicolon. Like:

        ici -e dbg.cmd=1 ...

    (timl)

*   Removed the Windows ICI debugger from the Windows build. It
    is now in ici-modules. (timl)

*   Stacked source markers on the execution stack during function
    calls. This stops them being wrong between function return, and
    the next source line. (timl)

*   Changed the path[] initialisation on UNIX-like systems to
    always include the lib/ici4 directory(s) under /usr/local,
    /opt and /sw if they exist, plus one optional place that
    can be specified in the conf file for any particular system.
    This was done to satisfy the reasons for Andy's change (see
    below), and also allow uniform binary distributions. (timl)

*   Changed icistr-setup.h and related macros in str.h (exported
    to ici.h) to avoid duplicate symbols in modules.  The
    init_ici_str() function is now made static to limit its
    scope to the file(s) that includes it. The ICIS et al
    macros in str.h (and exported to ici.h) now include
    the value of an ICI_MODULE_NAME macro within the symbol
    names.  This allows correct module loading on Mac OS X
    where the dynamic linker disallows duplicate symbols in
    loaded modules (bundles). The only impact for other platforms
    should be the potential for not sharing static string objects
    between modules that define the same strings. (andy)

*   Mac OS X module loading now uses bundles instead of the
    incorrect dynamic library usage.  The file extension for
    modules has changed to match this change, it was ".dylib"
    but is now ".bundle". (andy)

*   Upgraded the usage message and added -h/-? help. (timl)

*   Allowed '/' to introduced arguments as well as '-' on Windows.
    (timl)

*   Added ici_fetch_super() and ici_assign_super() macros to the
    public interface. (timl)

*   Added support for an optional 'base' argument to int() and
    num(). (timl)

*   Corrected some problems in float hashing, in particular when
    0.0 and -0.0 hash to different values but (until now) appeared
    to be equal. Also addressed some more subtle C issues. (timl)

*   Corrected a problem in interval() with a 0 start and no length
    argument. (timl)

*   Added support in handles to allow fetch, assign and method
    invocation. This has two interfaces, one cooked where the key
    is first converted to an integer ID, the other raw. One, or the
    other, or both may be used.

    There is a new function, ici_make_handle_method_map, and
    in a handle there are three new pointers: h_member_map, and
    the function pointers h_member_intf and h_generic_intf.
    See documentation. (timl)

*   Added 'ici_parse_fname' function to the API to parse a named
    file directly (because it's such a common case). (timl)

*   Added user-parsed literals and support functions. User-parsed
    literals allow things like:

        [ident stuff...]

    to be defined for things other than the built-in ones. The
    stuff... can be any syntax, built variously from low level
    character data, from standard ICI tokens, or from full ICI
    expressions. For example, the bignum extension now allows:

        x = [bignum 1000000000000];

    The mechanism works by getting a parser function by evaluating
    the ident (if it is callable, it is the function, else ident.parser
    is used). It then calls that function with the current parse stream
    file (as returned by currentfile()).

    There are new functions: parsetoken() and parsevalue() to read ICI
    tokens or expressions, as well as tokenobj(), rejecttoken(),
    and rejectchar() to assist. See new documentation.

*   Corrected objname functions of func and handle. Both had
    bugs that could cause crashes. (timl)

*   Added the default location to the initialisation of path[]
    for UNIX-like systems. This is to cope with the case where
    the interpreter is being run from a directory that is not
    in PATH which is often the case when ici programs are run
    as CGI scripts under a web server, e.g. Apache.  The default
    location is based on the value of PREFIX as specified in the
    Unix makefiles and passed as a macro when building, i.e. the
    directory PREFIX/lib/ici4 is added to path[]. (andy)

*   Got everything building and working under Cygwin. (timl)

*   Added ici_eval() to evaluate a variable name as the main
    interpreter does it (with auto-loading). (timl)

*   Added -e and -i options to ici34check.ici that make it
    automatically apply all the safe changes to the source files.
    (timl)

*   Makefile.osx updated for ici4 and a ProjectBuilder project,
    macosx/ici.pbproj, added to build a static library and
    executable.  Threads are not enabled due to lack of a
    functional sem_init() in the OS X pthreads. (andy)

*   Makefile.bsd updated for ici4 and now installs required
    headers and builds ici.h.  doc/ici.pdf is now installed as
    the documentation. (andy)

Changes in version 4.0.5

*   Added *lots* more API comments, which get extracted into
    the manual. The API documentation in the PDF manul
    is now complete, although not fully proofed. (timl)

*   A number of minor corrections to faults discovered in the
    previous release. Mostly make issues. (timl)

Changes in version 4.0.4 (first normal release of ICI 4)

*   Changed the default path[] initilialisation for UNIX-like
    systems. In addition to ICIPATH, it now adds any accessable
    directories called <wahtever>/lib/ici4 that parallel PATH
    elements that end in <whatever>/bin. This, at last, means that
    UNIX-like systems should reliably find extension modules without
    setting environment variables. (timl)

*   Started adding a lot more API documentation. Much of it will
    now be extracted from the source comments. (timl)

*   Changed types names to have ici_ prefixes. But added macros to
    allow back-ward compatibility. (timl)

*   After much deliberation I decided *not* to have the new 'proto'
    mechanism in the global new(). (timl)

*   Changed (any1 && any2) and (any1 || any2) so that if any1
    caused an early return, its value forms the result of the
    expression. Under the old behaviour it was resolved to 0 or 1.
    This is a semantic change to the language. I think it is unlikely
    to cause problems for old programs as it was not a useful
    feature (remember, is any2 got evaluated, it was returned,
    so the expression could not be expect to produce a numeric
    result in general). It might cause problems for new programs
    that end up getting run on old interpreters. (timl)

Changes in version 4.0.3 (first beta release of ICI 4)

*   Introduced a new "status" field to thread objects - values
    are "active", "finished", and "failed". (timl)

*   Updated Makefile.maint.

*   Added ici_ prefixes to yet more functions and reviewed what
    what is in the formal API and what wasn't. ici.h has been
    trimmed so seperately compiled modules can't see stuff they
    shouldn't. Some things that are done as macros in the core,
    are now done with functions for external modules to stop them
    being fragile with respect to internal implemenation. This
    all caused the backwards compatibale version to be set to 4.0.3
    (timl)

*   Allowed literal regular expressions (#...#) to be broken up as
    strings are. That is, multiple literal regular expressions seperated
    only by white space are concatenated before compilation. But also,
    you can mix in literal strings after the first #...#, and they
    are also concatenated and form part of the regular expression.
    This allows you to get # chars in more easily, and use string
    escape chars when you need to.

*   Allowed mutable (non-atomic) strings. Strings can now be either
    single-allocation (as they have been till now) or two-allocation.
    Single allocation strings are not growable and are always atomic
    and are the normal case. Seperate allocation is used when making
    a mutable string with the new strbuf() function. Also added
    strcat(). (timl)

*   Ifdefed out the hash stored in each string. Testing revealed it
    was faster without it. This is probably because there are a lot
    fewer calls to hash functions in general now due to efficiency
    gains in the atom pool handling. The extras memory bandwidth and
    cache misses were enough to make it a net penalty. (timl)

Changes in version 4.0.2 (an alpha release - binary interface not final)

*   Added printf to stderr in the case of an uncaught error in a
    sub-thread. This is a bit of a hack, but it is a bit of a pain
    working with threaded apps without it. (timl)

*   Introduced some version #defines and a function ici_interface_check()
    that external modules can call to check that they are not being
    invoked by a newer interpreter that they are not compatible with. (timl)

*   Removed include of <assert.h> from ici.h. (timl)

*   Changed atom_probe() to take an extra arg where it stores the location
    of the empty slot the object should go in it it wasn't found. This saves
    re-hashing and looking up where to put the newly allocated object.
    But there are some rules to its usage. Applied it to various objects
    including ints, floats and strings. (timl)

*   Changed file objects from being instrinsicly atomic. This didn't
    really make any sense. As it was, the cmp() function took the
    closed flag into account, but the closed flag changed even for
    atomic files (which is bad). (timl)

*   Added __TIME__ to the version string.

*   Changed a few compiled-form operators to have things in-line in
    the code array rather than having them pushed on the operand
    stack first. This saves a few main loop iterations. (timl)

*   Added macro ICI_OBJ_SET_TFNZ() to initialise the header of new
    objects, and phased out rego() (becomes ici_rego()) from setting
    o_leafz to zero.

*   Added auto-increment and indirect content types to build().
    This allows quick creation of sequential integer vectors, and
    more complex initialisations and data transposes. See documentation.
    (timl)

*   Woops. That string hash was no good. Had a good look at hashing
    in general and decided to go (back) to a CRC32 derived method.
    In theory the cache misses on the 4Kb table would be bad, but
    in practice the improvement in the hash result more than
    compensates. Added crc.c. Also made pointer hashes for struct
    lookup use the table. (timl)

Changes in version 4.0.1 (an alpha release)

*   Yet again changed various hash functions. In particular string,
    float and pointer hashing for structs. (timl)

*   Added a new function pointer, t_fetch_method, to the object
    type structure. This is a bit of a hack. If it is non-NULL, it
    is used in preference to the normal fetch when doing a fetch during
    method creation. It is to help Windows COM support. It is not
    used by any core types.

*   Added Micrsoft Visual Studio build stuff in a new "win32"
    directory. It contains a workspace and a bunch of projects to
    build the ICI DLL, wappers, the Windows ICI debugger, and an
    SDK installer (using NSIS - Nullsoft's free installer system).
    (timl)

*   Changed source line tracking. Now has a "most recently executed"
    source tag in the exec structure. Bit quicker, and probaly
    more reliable. (timl)

*   Added many test cases. These were added by examining code
    coverage, and adding test cases until all code that could
    be reached by a script was reached. Some of the fixes to
    problems revealed by this are detailed below. However there
    were others not mentioned in detail here. (timl)

*   Added test/tst-misc.ici, test/tst-prof.ici and test/tst-types.ici
    as part of test coverage upgrade. (timl)

*   Corrected failure to return NULL on empty gettokens in simple
    2 arg string, string case. (timl)

*   Corrected buffer overun when using large widths in printfs
    (such as %1000d). (timl)

*   Added ptr - int support. (timl)

*   Corrected failure to detect modification of an atomic array
    (in some circumstances). (timl)

*   Added special new printf format %a - 'any'. This accepts any
    object and produces a short (up to 30 chars) human readable
    interpretation of it. (timl)

*   Disabled popen in Win32 until a working Win32 popen is written.
    (Primitive popen() only works in console apps in Windows it
    seems.) (timl)

*   Allowed getfile() to be given a file name as argument. It is
    opened, read, and closed. (timl)

*   Added tmpname() function (ala the C lib tmpnam() function). (timl)

*   Changed getenv/putenv handling (again) to overcome problems
    when programs ici_uninit(), then exec something else, and
    some bugs in Windows case matching. (timl)

*   Added protection against execessive recursive core engine
    invocation (limit of 50 currently). (timl)

*   Fixed a rare but long standing bug relating to an inopportune
    collect while adding an atom to the atom pool. The symptom of
    this was failure to find an atom to be removed from the atom
    pool during collection (an assert in debug builds). (timl)

*   Huge number of fixes in parse.c relating to refernce count
    fixes in error cases. (timl)

Changes in version 4.0.0 (an alpha release)

*   Added stuff to build a Windows installer with a script based
    on NullSoft's free installer system. (timl)

*   Expanded the handle_t to support an optional private struct
    for storing local values. This makes it much easier to make
    C objects that act as first class ICI instances, including the
    ability to sub-class them and define new instance variables. (timl)

*   Added ici_module_new and ici_class_new functions to make it
    easier to make extensions and stuff. (timl)

*   Added more ici_ prefixes to more functions. (timl)

*   Added support for handle_t objects to ici_typecheck. They check
    that the handle is one of the correct type by a supplied name. (timl)

*   Changed the interface to ici_call[v] and ici_func[v] functions
    to be more consistent with other functions and take string_t *
    args instead of char * (now that string_t types are easier to
    get). Also added ici_method for making method calls from C. (timl)

*   Removed the socket functions from the core. They are now
    only accessable through the net module (also upgraded the
    net module to ici4, but that's in the ici-modules checkout).
    (timl)

*   Added support for [module:xxx and [module=xxx which actually
    never made it into ICI 3. Imroved the error reporting in that
    area. (timl)

*   Changed the extension module search path to go through a 'path'
    ICI variable (in the current scope), which is an array of dirs
    to search. This variable is set on startup from ICIPATH and well
    known locations (which vary with platform). It is program modifiable,
    and used on libray loads. (timl)

*   Changed the name of many functions. Mostly added ici_ prefixes.
    This is part of the documentation of the C API (I figure if
    there was ever a time they should get fixed, it is when they
    get documented.) (timl)

*   Made currentfile() layer on top of the parse context so that
    line numbers don't get out of sync. Also added an optional
    "raw" argument to produce the old behaviour. (timl)

*   Restored the ici4 prefix on auto-loading ici modules.
    It turns out not to be practical to leave off the version
    number. But I plan to add searching for the previous version
    number to solve the problem instead. (timl)

*   Corrected long standing ? : bug where the : was confused
    for a method operator in some circumstances. (timl)

*   Added an ici_pcre() function to avoid exposing internals
    of PCRE in the ici.h include file. (timl)

*   Changed the definition of the struct lookup look-aside cache
    stored in strings. It used to apply only to variables. But
    now it applies to all struct lookups. That meant it could be
    cleaned up and the number of times it is invalidated (by
    incrementing ici_vsver) greatly reduced. This makes a good
    improvement in execution speed. (timl)

*   Generalised the super mechanism. Objects that want to support
    a super (still only structs in the core language) use the
    new type objwsup_t (object-with-super) instead of object_t
    as their header. This includes the super poiner. They must
    then also set the O_SUPER flag in their header. They must also
    support some extra fetch/assign functions.

    There are quiet a few place where struct_t types became
    objwsup_t types as a consequence of this. (timl)

*   Removed the version number from the naming of auto-loading
    ICI modules (but not native code modules). Thus, for example,
    the version 3 startup file was called:

       ici3core.ici

    but it will now be called

       icicore.ici

    I think the ICI language (as opposed to its internal APIs)
    is sufficiently stable that it is not really required.
    I found it an unnecessary inconvenience. (timl)

*   Changed chkbuf() to ici_chkbuf(). (timl)

*   Added a new basic type "handle". This not accessible from the
    core language, but C code can use it to return generic references
    to C data objects. It supports a super pointer, so C code
    can associate a class (i.e. a struct full of intrinsic methods)
    with it to allow it to be used as an OO object (which can also
    identify it as an object of the expected type when passed back
    from ICI code). It also allows a type name to be associated
    with the handle which will appear in diagnostics. (timl)

*   Changed 'error' to 'ici_error'. (timl)

*   Changed ici_evaluate() to use a catch object on its C stack
    as its frame marker on its ICI execution stack. This avoids
    an object allocation on each ici_evaluate call. The arguments
    to ici_evaluate have changed slightly as a consequence. (timl)

*   Removed syscall functions from the core. They will only
    be accessible through the sys module in future. (timl)

*   Changed the allocation routines to allocate small objects
    densly (no boundary words) out of larger chunks. The
    technique for eliminating boundary words, and keeping the
    fast  free lists, is to have alloc/free routines where
    the caller is required to tell the free how much memory
    it asked for on the  alloc. Thus we have:

        x = ici_talloc(type);
        ...
        ici_tfree(x, type);

    and

        x = ici_nalloc(size);
        ...
        ici_nfree(x, size);

    98% of the time this is really easy because the place you
    free the data knows exectly how big it is. For the occasions
    where this is not convenient, you can use the completely
    malloc/free equivalent:

        x = ici_alloc(size);
        ...
        ici_free(x);

    (timl)

*   Added a small array (32) of pre-generated small ints to allow
    a quick check and use of these very common numbers. (timl)

*   Changed the internal ICI calling convention. The call operator
    object used to store the number of actual parameters to a
    function. Now a seperate int is pushed onto the operand
    stack. There is now just a single static call operator.
    Because ints are now heavily optimised, a call from C to ICI
    now, typically, does no allocation until its in the main
    execution engine. (timl)

*   Moved the lib curses based text window feature out of the core.
    Will put it in an extension module soon. (timl)

*   Changed new_array() to take an int argument being the initial
    number of slots for the array to have. The caller can assume
    that that many items can be pushed on. Use 0 for the default
    value. (timl)

*   Changed arrays so that they can be efficiently push()ed and
    pop()ed at *both* ends. Thus they can be used to form efficent
    queues. Although apparently a small feature, queues are something
    that I've always felt were important and missing from ICI.
    However this was a *big* change (much harder than the
    object header change). The parser and execution engine rely
    heavily on arrays for their efficiency. To prevent an impact
    on them we distinguish arrays that have neve been used as a
    queue (never had the new functions rpush() or rpop() done on
    them) from the general case. Virgin arrays are refered to as
    stacks and have all the old semantics. But in the general case
    arrays are now growable circular buffers. Were you don't know
    the origin or history of an array, you must assume the general
    case and use some new knowledge, functions and macros to access it.
    (timl)

*   Removed the feature of binary << that allowed "array << int".
    This has been flagged for removal in the documentation for a
    long time, and became difficult to support. (timl)

*   Changed the universal object header(!) From 2 x 32 bit
    words to 1 x 32 bit word. Theoretically this is a huge
    change, but it was actually pretty easy. It requires
    recompilation of external modules, and some changes to their
    source. Basically the type is now completely indicated by
    the small int o_tcode field of the header. To find a pointer
    to the type structure you must index an array of pointers to
    them. Use ici_typeof(o) for this. Types must now register their
    type_t structure to obtain their small int type code, which
    they should remember and use when making new objects. After this
    change, the next release will move to version 4 to keep extension
    modules with the new smaller objects seperate.

    The overall effect on CPU time seems to be neutral or a
    slight improvement. (timl)

*   Added multi-threading. This is based on native machine threads,
    but the whole mass of ICI objects and static data is gated
    through a single mutex. So it works fine except threads competing
    for the ICI execution engine will not take advantage of multiple
    processors (but they will if they spend their time in functions
    that release the mutex while running).

    It was a little difficult to achieve this without slowing things
    down. Introducing a single extra indirection in top-of-stack
    accesses (the obvious way) adds up to 20% to the execution time
    of some programs. But I managed it.

    New language contructs "waitfor (expr; obj) stmt" and
    "critsetc stmt" have been added. As well as the "wakeup(obj)"
    and "sleep(num)" functions. All I/O routines in the core
    release the mutex around the low level I/O - except the parser.
    (See new documentation.)

    In the process, o_top, x_top and v_top macros got removed.
    Use ici_os.a_top instead. (timl)

*   The ICI Technical Description has been updated to
    FrameMaker 6 format and split into seperate chapters;
    each in a seperate source file. (timl)

*   Removed the obsolete function ici_op_offsq() and operator
    o_offsq from from array.c, ici.def, and fwd.h. (timl)

Changes in version 3.0.1

*   Made struct() accept a NULL super to be consistent with
    super() and to simplify calling of struct() in some circumstances.

*   Changed the auto-loading mechanism to call the function
    load() in the current scope rather than just do the work
    in-line. This allows programs to sandbox untrusted
    code by controlling the scope the untrusted code has
    access to. By modifying or removing load() the program
    can filter or deny module loading to untrsted code. (timl)

*   ICI level signal handling introduced via signals.c and
    new conditional NOSIGNALS. Two functions are added for
    ICI code - signal() and signam() (returns the name of
    a signal given its number, could be an array). See the
    signals.c file for further information. (andy)

*   BSD makefile changed to use ici3 as the program name,
    manpage name, library, etc... ici3 co-exists with ici (v2)
    $ICIPATH defaults to /usr/local/lib/ici3 to allow ici3
    to be completely independent of v2 to make clean ups
    easier. You can of course add the old lib/ici to ICIPATH
    to pick up ici modules but native code libraries are
    not compatible (internal name changes for one).
    Other Unix makefiles should change as well. (andy)

*   f_include() now searches ICIPATH for the file if it can't
    be directly opened. get_dll_path in load.c now exported
    as ici_get_dll_path (andy)

*   startup file stuff removed as icicore.ici removes the
    need for it (trace junk should be next) (andy)

*   added in the code for proto structs in classes but it
    isn't activated (new NOCLASSPROTO macro is defined by
    default). (andy)

*   Added a respondsto() method to query if class instances
    have a method with a particular name. (andy)

*   Changed the ICI main programs to use the name 'ici3' rather
    than just 'ici'. Also updated the required name format
    for extension modules to be 'ici3xxx.zzz'.
    This is to allow complete simultaneuos co-existence of old
    (version 2) ICI and new (to be version 3) ICI. (timl)

*   Changed the Windows ICI debugger to be a dynamically
    loading extension module 'widb'. It contains the functions
    widb.break() and widb.view(obj). It installs itself as the
    debugger and enables debugging on first load. (timl)

*   For Windows (only) changed the search path for extension
        modules to be similar to that used by LoadLibrary(). This
        makes it less suprising to Windows users. (timl)

*   Introduced some macros to assist extension modules in getting
    their ICI strings defined. See str.h. (timl)

*   Introduced ici.h for non-core compilations to use. It is
    built with the script mk-ici-h.ici using cut-marks that have
    been added around the exportable sections of many include
    files. (timl)

*   Added built-in new() and isa() methods and made copy()
    operate both as a function and a method. (timl)

*   Added the function build(). This can recursively build
    multi-dimensional arrays and structs and populate leaf
    fields with data in a manner similar to the APL rho
    operator. (timl)

*   Added the new operator := which acts like assignment
    except if the assinment is going into a struct (either
    explicitly, or implicitly with assignment to a variable)
    it ignores super-structs. Thus := with a variable on the
    left always assigns to an auto (making it if necessary),
    and s.k := v is equivalent to assign(s, k, v). (timl)

*   Added ici_ prefixes to some global identifiers:
    ex => ici_ex
    func_type => ici_func_type
    cfunc_type => ici_cfunc_type

*   Modified the call() function to allow:

            call(func, arg1, arg2... array);

        because call(func, array(arg1, arg2...) + array); seems to
        be very common (and inefficient). The last arg must be an
        array or NULL. (timl)

*   Introduced a standard extension module 'icicore.ici' that is
    loaded automatically on startup. This module contains core
    language features that are implemented in ICI, not C. It
    is a bit magic, because on load it exports its externs into
    the global interpreter scope. It is kept small for efficiency.
    Many functions are defined as stubs that will parse and replace
    themselves with more code on first call. The extra code is
    in sub modules called icicore1.ici, icicore2.ici, etc. (timl)

*   Expanded the assign() function to work on any type (not just
    structs). Just does a plain assignment for non-structs. Also
    made the 3rd argument optional; NULL assumed if absent. (timl)

*   Expanded the del() function to work on sets and arrays (not
    just structs). Del from a set is just like a struct. Del from
    an array removes the first occurence of the given object from
    the array and shuffles the other elements down - shortening
    it in the process. del() returns 1 if it removed an element
    from an array. In all other cases it returns NULL. (timl)

*   Allowed "abbreviated function definitions" in [struct...]
    literals (as well as [class...] literals) and made the
    '= expr' optional (meaning '= NULL'). Thus one may say:

    x = [struct
        a = 10,
        f(z){return z + 1;},
        b,
        c
    ]

    printf("%d, %d\n", x.a, x.f(2));

    See updated documentation for details. (timl)

*   Introduced the ability to parse sub-modules in-line
    with [module...] syntax (as well as extend modules in
    the same manner). Thus one may say:

    sub_module = [module
        static x = 5;
        extern fred(a, b){return a + b + x};
        printf("Hello world.\n");
    ];

    c = fred(1, 2);

    See updated documentation for details. (timl)

*   Allowed C++ style // comments.

*   Moved definition of stdin, stdout, stderr from icimain
    to init. (timl)

*   Introduced a size measure into a previously unused byte
    in the object header. This may be set to the memory cost
    of strictly leaf (ie, no sub-object pointers) objects after
    calling rego() on the object to allow the mark() macro to
    avoid a function call. (Real performance gain yet to be
    evaluated.) (timl)

*   Introduced implicit definition of undefined variables used
    in assignments as auto variables. This goes along with a
    style rule that such implicit variables should have short
    (one or two character) names. (timl)

*   Introduced a new method of achieving object-oriented
    programming. This is a set of changes that includes
    the [class...] syntax for making structs that are
    suitable as objects, a method object that is a binding
    of a function and a subject object, and : and :^
    operators that generate methods for calls to base
    class and super class methods.

    See updated documentation for details. (timl)

*   Expanded the type_t structure to include (a) a cached
    string_t version of the type name to speed up typeof(),
    (b) an objname() function to allow better debug naming from
    non-core objects, and (c) a per-type function call
    implementation method. This means that any object type can
    now expand its nature by defining function calls on it (as
    well as indexing). NOTE: this change means that extension
    modules will need re-compilation. No source changes should
    be necessary.

    Associated with the change is the splitting of 'user' level
    ICI functions, from C implemented functions, from method
    calls, from ptr calls. (timl)

*   Made implode() more efficient. (timl)

*   Introduced the C type sstring_t which is a string_t with
    room for a short string built in. This allows the core
    language to have statically declared strings (provided
    they are atomised at init time). This means that string
    references in core language source can now just look like, say:

        *a->a_top++ = SSO(fred);

    instead of, say:

        if ((*a->a_top = objof(get_cname("fred"))) == NULL)
            goto fail;
        ++a->a_top;

    lots of code was simplified with this. See sstring.h in
    which each desired string must be mentioned. Note that
    this is *only* available in core language files. It can
    not be used from extension modules. (timl)

*   Changed Makefile.w32 to make the ICI dll called ici3.dll.
    Including the version number should allow for co-existence
    of old and new versions and smoother upgrades. (timl)

*   Split regular expression functions sub() and gsub() out of
    cfunc.c into a new file refuncs.c and added new expanded
    smash() function based on regular expressions (backwards
    compatible with the old deprecated smash() function for
    now). gsub() is also more efficient now. It used to be
    slow on many substitutions on multi-megabyte strings. (timl)

*   Improved overall execution speed by introducing a shadow
    stack to the execution stack that holds program counters (an
    internal object never seen by user code). Previously program
    counters were allocated whenever a code fragement started
    execution (although avoided for most loops). Now they are
    reused from a store kept in parallel with the execution stack.
    This greatly reduces small object churn through the garbage
    collector. (timl)

*   Improved integer and float calculation performance by
    introducing a shadow stack of the operand stack that
    holds strictly temporary mutable ints and floats. These
    temporaries are not resolved to their atomic forms
    and are not suitable for general use within the interpreter.
    The compiler generates binary operators that are flagged
    as allowed to result in one of these temporary objects, as
    the compiler has determined that the result is used strictly
    by value in a single subsequent operation. The net result of
    this is that expressions like:

        x = a + 1.2 * c - 10;

    only perform a single resolution to atomic form when the
    final result is produced (as opposed to the three the above
    example would previously have done). This can result in
    less churn of small objects and so less garbage collections.
    It certainly results in less atom pool look-ups. (timl)

*   Added a define of ICI_CORE to each of the core language
    files prior to any includes. This allows the include files
    to know if they are being included in a build of the core
    engine as opposed to an extension module. Currently this
    is only required to adjust some Windows specific declarations.
    It means that builds of extensions modules under Windows no
    longer need to define ICI_DLL in their makefile. (timl)

*   Expanded tabs to spaces in most files. Four space indents
    implemented with spaces rather than tabs is now the preferred
    ICI C source fomatting convention. Mostly because it is
    a hassle to convince Windows tools that tabs are 8 columns
    apart. (timl)

*   Changed the parser so that code arrays are no longer reduced
    to atoms. This has been a waste of time ever since source
    markers went in. This speeds up parseing. (timl)

Changes in version 2.1.4 of ICI

*   Various minor bug fixes and performance enhancements.

*   Added doc/building.html to record issues associated with
    building ICI. This document is hand-crafted HTML to
    support simultaneous updates and revision control.

*   Changed Makefile.w32 to build ici as a DLL (not an EXE)
    under Windows. Two main programs are also built - ici.exe
    and wici.exe. The first is a console ici, the second is
    a windows ici (ie, no console window - only windows you
    make exist). This DLL executable structure is prefered
    under windows because dynamically loaded ICI extensions
    refer to the main ici module by *name*, so ICI extensions can
    only be used from ici.exe. Not from any other program
    that includes ICI as a component. But if they refer to
    ici.dll, there are less problems. It also allows both
    a console app and a windows app from the same compiled
    code.

Changes in version 2.1.3 of ICI

*   More complete list of exported symbols for Windows.  (andy)

*   BeOS port courtesy of Tim Vernum <tpv@acay.com.au>.

*   Introduced a file, PLATFORM, to document platform-specifics
    for ici.  There's not much in there yet, i.e, nothing, but
    that's where things should go.  (andy)

*   Fix to the skt_getch() function to stop it returning
    an incorrect value on EOF.  This could cause input
    functions (e.g., getline) to keep reading until they
    ran out of memory.  (andy)

*   PCRE updated to version 2.08.  This fixes a few problems in
    PCRE and has slight performance improvements (see pcre for
    details).  (andy)

*   String hash function exported so others can rehash strings
    allocated via new_string().  (andy)

*   FreeBSD configuration should work for 2.x or 3.x systems with
    various changes to the Makefile to make it a better citizen.
    (andy)

*   There is a new command line option, -v, which outputs a
    message to stderr describing the version of ici (as defined
    by ici_version_string in conf.c) and then exits.  (andy)

*   ici_call and ici_funcv now support C functions calling ICI
    object member functions using '@'. ici_call("foo", "o@", obj)
    fetches the member foo from obj and executes it, passing obj
    as the first parameter (in the same manner as obj@foo() in ICI).
    '@' comes before '=' in the parameter list, so
    ici_call("foo", "o@f=oi", obj, &fval, obj2, ival) is valid.

*   The exit() function, when passed a string actual parameter that
    contains a colon (':') will NOT prefix that string with "exit".
    This allows nicer looking error messages to be produced easily,
    e.g., if (argc < 2) exit("usage: myname argument...");  (andy)

*   WIDB will now show function arguments and auto variables.

*   Small fix to f_call() so it doesn't crash when the second
    argument is of an incorrect type (i.e., not an array).  (andy)

*   Made BUGHUNT code compile and work again.  I reckon BUGHUNT
    should always be defined for debug build of ICI (oliverb).

Changes in version 2.1.2 of ICI

*   string(#regular expression#) now returns the string that
    the regular expression was compiled from.

*   WIDB: You can now see how much memory an ICI object (and those
    it points to) occupy.  Just press 'M' when the object is
    selected.  Objects above this object in the tree view are
    avoid in order to ignore _parent-style back links.
    'T' displays total memory occupied by ICI objects.

*   The long deprecated ``sizeof'' has been removed. Use nels().

*       Fixed an obscure problem with sprintf("%c", 0x84) and
        setlocale(LC_ALL, "") under VC++.

*       The profiler view shown with WIDB now shows
         - the call graph,
         - the time spent in each function including functions
           it calls, and
         - the time spent in each function not including time
           spent in functions it calls.

*       The WIDB object view dialog now sorts sets and struct
        keys.  This makes it easier to find and compare objects.

*       An embarassing bug in the profiler has been fixed; it
        now also counts the number of times a function is called;
        and Win32 now uses the multimedia timers, giving millisecond
        accuracy.

*       WIDB can now load resources from a separate module to that
        which it's compiled into.  See WIDB_set_resources().

*       Fixed bug in regexp.c, it was hashing its string when being
        garbage collected (via unatom()), but the string had been
        collected first (they go together).  Now we just hash the
        pointer to the string, which is OK (and faster) because the
        string is of course atomic.

*   There is now a load() function to explicitly load modules. Load()
    is a manual way of autoloading and allows finer control over
    naming of modules.

*   The sort() function now allows the callback to be passed an
    optional "user" argument. This is any object. The callback
    is now called with three arguments, the two objects to compare
    and the user object which defaults to NULL. The sort()
    function can now be called with one, two or three parameters.
    The user parameter may only be passed if a user defined
    callback is given. The default callback makes no use of
    a user parameter.

*       The Windows ICI debugger (widb) now runs in a separate
        thread, the calling application is completely blocked
        while debugging.  Now also show whether an aggregate is
        atomic in the object viewer.

Changes in version 2.1.1 of ICI

*   getenv() and putenv() have been replaced with a version
    that copes with putenv() implementation differences. Putenv()
    is now enabled in all interpreters.

*   A Windows ici debugger is provided as an example debugger
    in the widb directory. A command line debugger, icid, is
    available separately.

*   An event processing mechansim has been added. Currently only
    for Win32 but other versions will appear. This is experimental
    and may change in future releases.

*   A simple millisecond timing profiler has been added, #undef
        NOPROFILE to activate it and use the profile(outfile)
        function in your ICI to start profiling.  Profiling continues
        until the initial function ends and then

         - writes output to 'outfile' in ICI format, and

         - calls any function specified by calling
           ici_profile_set_done_callback() (for example,
           the Windows ICI debugger uses this function to register
           an ICI object viewer).

*       The objname() function has been fixed so that it correctly
        outputs the names of functions.

*   An ``uninit'' function has been added to the interpreter. This
    function frees up all resources allocated by the interpreter
    allowing easier use in some situations.

*   Expression parsing optimisations.

*   abs() is now a builtin. It returns the absolute value of its
    argument, either an int or float.

*   The sort() function has been modified to provide a default
    compare function that uses the relational operators to
    determine the result. In addition sort() now returns the now
    sorted array. This makes sort easier to use, e.g., this code
    works as many would expect,

        forall (file in sort(dir()))
            printf("%s\n", file);

    The sort() wrapper in the startup file has been removed.

*   The dir() function now uses the correct file name length whichs
    allows the regexp matching to operate correctly.

*   Documentation updates.

*   The name associated with auto-loaded ICI module files now
    includes the "ici" prefix and ".ici" extension. This allows
    a debugger to trace through auto-loaded ICI modules.

*   Makefile.maint updated to reflect new PCRE file names.

*   The version #s in conf.c were wrong and have been updated.

*   The configuration string previously defined in the configuration
    headers is now generated in conf.c (by looking at the various
    defines). The CONFIG_STR macro defined in the configuration headers
    is now defined to be some descriptive text that is put in the ICI
    version string compiled into the executable.

*   The debug functions have been renamed so they all start with
    "ici_debug". The interface has also been refined following the
    writing of an actual debugger. The ici_main() function now has
    a debugging counterpart, ici_maind, that enables debugging
    following parsing the startup file. Debuggers use ici_maind
    to run the program being debugged rather than ici_main.

*   Updated PCRE to version 2.04. No changes required to ICI
    itself and only a few changes to PCRE.

*   Fixed a few Makefile problems on various platforms.

*   Socket hashing synchronised to ensure atoms are found. It
    got broken in the merging that's been going on.

Changes in version 2.1 of ICI

*   Dynamic loading of ICI and native machine code modules has
    been added and documented. The files load.c and findpath.c
    were added in the process.

*   ICI now supports a debugger interface. The debug() function is
    used to enable debugging or test the state of debugging. The
    standard interpreter has a null debugger which may be replaced
    simply by linking the debugger front-end against the normal
    ICI library (which is, on Unix systems, now installed). The
    files idb.c and idb2.c were added and exec.c modified.

*   Stack manipulation in the execution loop has been optimised.

*   The sockets code has had many fixes and a few speed ups. The
    send and receive style functions are now useful.

*   Unix ICI parses a file of ICI code every time it runs. This
    is used to write some standard functions in ICI. There is a
    switch, -s, to not load this file. See ici_init.ici for
    details of what is provided.

*   PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions - has been adopted
    as the ICI regexp package. This package not only provides Perl 5
    compatible regular expressions it has fewer bugs and is far
    faster than the previous code. The new code has been measured
    on real data as more than twice as fast as the old code on
    complex patterns and never slower on simple patterns. PCRE
    is also license compatible with ICI.

*   Unix makefiles now have a "fancy" install target that
    installs the binary, man page, library, headers, documentation
    and some startup code. Primarially of benefit to module
    writers who can point the compiler at the standard ICI headers
    directory. Also defines a standard place to install ICI modules.

*   More functions have been exported for the benefit of some
    modules (Andy Newman's object serialisation).

*   The ICI Technical Description (doc/ici.fm4) has been expanded
    and general reproduction rights granted. It has also changed
    to FrameMaker 5 format and is now called doc/ici.fm.

*   Many ici_ prefixes have been introduced on functions and data
    objects. Some obscure or historical function names have changed
    to more rational ones. The changes likely to effect existing
    code are:

    got => incref
    loose => decref
    zalloc => ici_alloc
    zfree => ici_free
    typecheck => ici_typecheck
    retcheck => ici_retcheck
    argici_error => ici_argerror
    argcount => ici_argcount
    obj_ret => ici_ret_with_decref
    loose_ret => ici_ret_no_decref

*   Many bug fixes contributed by Alexander Demenshin have been
    incorporated into the base code. Major changes include;

    o   More efficient select() in the sockets code.
    o   Strings now store their hash values and only compute
        them once, when the string is created. This improves
        performance considerably. The new regular expression
        code also benefits from this.
    o   rand() function may be C library rand() (see cfunc.c).
    o   special case code for gettokens() to speed up a common,
        simple case.
    o   More leak fixes to sub()/gsub().

*   The first argument of type functions (mark, hash, cmp, copy,
    assign, fetch, free), which used to be specified in each
    actual function as the specific type in question, are now
    declared object_t *. This means that the types of the functions
    in the type struct can be correctly prototyped. But it does mean
    there are more explicit conversions in the actual function
    implementations.

*   A function declared with the abbreviated syntax (i.e. the
    normal way) now has the function name assigned to the
    implicitly created auto variable _funcname_. This allows
    stack traces based on the contents of the scope stack
    (aka vstack) to include function names.

*   Makefile install targets now pass -c to install.

Changes in version 2.0.3 of ICI

*   Makefile.maint is useful again. This is used for packaging
    source distribution and similar maintainance tasks.

*   The old Linux Makefile and configuration files, Makefile.lgx
    and conf-lgx.h, have been removed. Use the '.linux' files
    instead. Also the mkstruct.c file has been removed because
    it wasn't used in the interpreter. If you need it for some-
    thing it is still in the earlier versions.

*   Gary Gendel's IRIX port is now incorporated. This adds
    Makefile.irix and a conf-irix.h and adds some more #ifdefs
    to syscall.c (see TODO).

*   The MS VC++ generated makefiles have been removed. They're
    huge and don't work well with version control. They can be
    easily generated if required. The default Win32 build uses
    Makefile.w32 and nmake.exe. In addition the conf_w95.h file
    has been removed as it is no longer used. The conf-w32.h
    file defines the Win32 configuration (which is almost as
    complete as the Unix versions of ICI).

*   The socket type now has its own prime used when hashing.
    This should make some code a little faster (although it
    may even slow things down) although it isn't expected to
    be noticeable.

*   The Makefiles have been added to. There are now "install" and
    "clean" targets in these files (Makefile.w32 has no install
    target).

*   The exec() function is now complemented by the execp() function
    which searches along the user's $PATH to find the executable.

*   Various documentation updates and all documents have been moved
    into a `doc' subdirectory.

*   ICI now has a man page - ici.1 - look in the doc directory.

*   The domainname() function has been removed from the sockets
    code. This is an NIS thing that isn't too useful.

*   Linux and Win32 versions now in better shape. Linux version
    has sockets, directory reading and password file access
    enabled (as do the Solaris, SunOS and BSD versions).

*   put() now detects write errors and raises an error if writes
    are failing.

Changes in version 2.0.2 of ICI

*   Directory used with '-l' option changed to /usr/local/etc/ici
    as CISRA's /usr/local/include is architecture dependent.

*   Various fixes and usability mods to sockets interface,

    -   gethostbyaddr works
    -   bind accepts a string or integer as the port and also
        allows having the system pick a free port number.
    -   a shutdown function exists

*   Configuration files (conf-XXX.h) updated. New conf-sample.h file
    showing potential configuration options.

*   Fixed del() to update VSVER which caused cached lookups of string
    objects to be incorrect and crash the interpreter.

*   eof() now defaults to testing stdin like other input functions.

*   Numerous documentation fixes.

*   Hash functions for sets and structs fixed (had a `;' in the
    wrong place). Atomic sets and structs now far faster.

*   Now supports Win32 environments (i.e., Windows 95 and Windows NT)
    with many of the "Unix system calls" available.

*   A getcwd() function was added.

*   Unix password file access routine, passwd() (see docs).

*   Solaris 2.x configuration builds without reference to UCB libraries.

*   Excessive memory allocation in array objects tamed.

*   Now supports BSD 4.4 (tested under FreeBSD 2.x)

*   Numerous bug fixes with special attention paid to memory leaks.

*   New regexp test program (see test directory).

*   New "method call" operator allows support for object-orientated
    programming. See documentation for details.

*   New intrinsic functions,

        dir Reads names from a directory and perform optional
            pattern matching (regexp) to return an array of
            strings. E.g.,

                forall (srcfile in dir("../ici", #\.[ch]$#))
                printf("ICI source file %s\n", srcfile);

        remove  Delete a file. More portable than unlink().

        getcwd  Returns name of the current directory.

*   Error handling in seek() now operational.

*   Sockets code has own file type implemenation making it more
    usuable and portable to WIN32 (old code used fdopen() to turn
    a socket descriptor into a FILE * which meant the socket got
    closed when the file was closed, now it doesn't get closed
    when the file object is closed).

*   Implementation of select() modified to make it portable to
    WIN32 and more efficient.

*   gsub() and sub() properly implement \n replacements.

*   Off by one allocation error in do_sub() fixed.

Changes in version 2.0.1 of ICI.

*   New builtin function regexpi() which produces a case-
    insensitive compiled regular expression from a string.
    Note there is no literal form of case-insensitive regexps.

*   Port to Solaris 2 (aka SunOS 5). See the files conf-sol2.h
    and Makefile.sol2.

*   Document reclaim() builtin.

*   Code cleaned up a little to minimise warnings from various
    compilers (mainly gcc under SunOS as that is what I use - AN).

*   Fixes to some memory leak and reference counting bugs. Most
    sinister was one in parse.c relating to struct literals and
    their super structs.

*   Fixes to (very) broken reference counting in skt.c

*   Introduced new internal function, null_ret(), for ICI intrinsic
    functions that return the NULL object (less typing than the
    "obj_ret(objof(&o_null))" that was being used everywhere).

*   Better memory debugging support (see alloc.c/alloc.h).
