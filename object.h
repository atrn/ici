/*
 * t_mark(o)            Must sets the ICI_O_MARK flag in o->o_flags of this object

 *                      already have ICI_O_MARK set.  Returns the approximate
 *                      memory cost of this and all other objects it sets the
 *                      ICI_O_MARK of.  Typically recurses on all referenced
 *                      objects which don't already have ICI_O_MARK set (this
 *                      recursion is a potential problem due to the
 *                      uncontrolled stack depth it can create).  This is only
 *                      used in the marking phase of garbage collection.
 *
 *                      The macro ici_mark() calls the t_mark function of the
 *                      object (based on object type) if the ICI_O_MARK flag of
 *                      the object is clear, else it returns 0.  This is the
 *                      usual interface to an object's mark function.
 *
 *                      The mark function implemantation of objects can assume
 *                      the ICI_O_MARK flag of the object they are being invoked
 *                      on is clear.
 *
 * t_free(o)            Must free the object o and all associated data, but not
 *                      other objects which are referenced from it.  This is
 *                      only called from garbage collection.  Care should be
 *                      taken to remember that errors can occur during object
 *                      creation and that the free function might be asked to
 *                      free a partially allocated object.
 *
 * t_cmp(o1, o2)        Must compare o1 and o2 and return 0 if they are the
 *                      same, else non zero.  This similarity is the basis for
 *                      merging objects into single atomic objects and the
 *                      implementation of the == operator.
 *
 *                      Currently only zero versus non-zero results are
 *                      significant.  However in future versions the t_cmp()
 *                      function may be generalised to return less than, equal
 *                      to, or greater than zero depending if 'o1' is less
 *                      than, equal to, or greater than 'o2'.  New
 *                      implementations would be wise to adopt this usage now.
 *
 *                      Some objects are by nature both unique and
 *                      intrinsically atomic (for example, objects which are
 *                      one-to-one with some other allocated data which they
 *                      alloc when the are created and free when they die).
 *                      For these objects the existing function
 *                      ici_cmp_unique() can be used as their implementation
 *                      of this function.
 *
 *                      It is very important in implementing this function not
 *                      to miss any fields which may otherwise distinguish two
 *                      obejcts.  The cmp, hash and copy operations of an
 *                      object are all related.  It is useful to check that
 *                      they all regard the same data fields as significant in
 *                      performing their operation.
 *
 * t_copy(o)            Must returns a copy of the given object.  This is the
 *                      basis for the implementation of the copy() function.
 *                      On failure, NULL is returned and error is set.  The
 *                      returned object has been ici_incref'ed.  The returned
 *                      object should cmp() as being equal, but be a distinct
 *                      object for objects that are not intrinsically atomic.
 *
 *                      Intrinsically atomic objects may use the existing
 *                      function ici_copy_simple() as their implemenation of
 *                      this function.
 *
 *                      Return NULL on failure, usual conventions.
 *
 * t_hash(o)            Must return an unsigned long hash which is sensitive
 *                      to the value of the object.  Two objects which cmp()
 *                      equal should return the same hash.
 *
 *                      The returned hash is used in a hash table shared by
 *                      objects of all types.  So, somewhat problematically,
 *                      it is desireable to generate hashes which have good
 *                      spread and seperation across all objects.
 *
 *                      Some objects are by nature both unique and
 *                      intrinsically atomic (for example, objects which are
 *                      one-to-one with some other allocated data which they
 *                      alloc when the are created and free when they die).
 *                      For these objects the existing function
 *                      'ici_hash_unique()' can be used as their
 *                      implementation of this function.
 *
 * t_assign(o, k, v)    Must assign to key 'k' of the object 'o' the value
 *                      'v'.  Return 1 on error, else 0.
 *
 *                      The existing function 'ici_assign_fail()' may be used
 *                      both as the implementation of this function for object
 *                      types which do not support any assignment, and as a
 *                      simple method of generating an error for particular
 *                      assignments which break some rule of the object.
 *
 *                      Not that it is not necessarilly wrong for an
 *                      intrinsically atomic object to support some form of
 *                      assignment.  Only for the modified field to be
 *                      significant in a 't_cmp()' operation.  Objects which
 *                      are intrinsically unique and atomic often support
 *                      assignments.
 *
 *                      Return non-zero on failure, usual conventions.
 *
 * t_fetch(o, k)        Fetch the value of key 'k' of the object 'o'.  Return
 *                      NULL on error.
 *              
 *                      Note that the returned object does not have any extra
 *                      reference count; however, in some circumstances it may
 *                      not have any garbage collector visible references to
 *                      it.  That is, it may be vunerable to a garbage
 *                      collection if it is not either incref()ed or hooked
 *                      into a referenced object immediately.  Callers are
 *                      responsible for taking care.
 *
 *                      The existing function 'ici_fetch_fail()' may be used
 *                      both as the implementation of this function for object
 *                      types which do not support any assignment, and as a
 *                      simple method of generating an error for particular
 *                      fetches which break some rule of the object.
 *
 *                      Return NULL on failure, usual conventions.
 *
 * t_name               The name of this type. Use for the implementation of
 *                      'typeof()' and in error messages.  But apart from that,
 *                      type names have no fundamental importance in the
 *                      langauge and need not even be unique.
 *
 * t_objname(o, p)      Must place a short (less than 30 chars) human readable
 *                      representation of the object in the given buffer.
 *                      This is not intended as a basis for re-parsing or
 *                      serialisation.  It is just for diagnostics and debug.
 *                      An implementation of 't_objname()' must not allocate
 *                      memory or otherwise allow the garbage collector to
 *                      run.  It is often used to generate formatted failure
 *                      messages after an error has occured, but before
 *                      cleanup has completed.
 *
 * t_call(o, s)         Must call the object 'o'.  If the object does not
 *                      support being called, this should be NULL.  If 's' is
 *                      non-NULL this is a method call and s is the subject
 *                      object of the call.  Return 1 on error, else 0.
 *                      The environment upon calling this function is
 *                      the same as that for intrinsic functions. Functions
 *                      and techniques that can be used in intrinsic function
 *                      implementations can be used in the implementation of
 *                      this function. The object being called can be assumed
 *                      to be on top of the operand stack
 *                      (i.e. ici_os.a_top[-1])
 *
 * t_ici_name           A 'ici_str_t' copy of 't_name'. This is just a cached
 *                      version so that typeof() doesn't keep re-computing the
 *                      string.
 *
 * t_fetch_method       An optional alternative to the basic 't_fetch()' that
 *                      will be called (if supplied) when doing a fetch for
 *                      the purpose of forming a method.  This is really only
 *                      a hack to support COM under Windows.  COM allows
 *                      remote objects to have properties, like
 *                      object.property, and methods, like object:method().
 *                      But without this special hack, we can't tell if a
 *                      fetch operation is supposed to perform the COM get/set
 *                      property operation, or return a callable object for a
 *                      future method call.  Most objects will leave this
 *                      NULL.
 *
 *                      Return NULL on failure, usual conventions.
 *
 * t_forall_step        An optional alternative to the predefined type
 *                      support in the 'forall' statement
 *                      implementation.  This functions performs a
 *                      single step of a forall loop, either assigning
 *                      a key/value for the next iteration or
 *                      indicating the end of the loop has been
 *                      reached.  The function is passed the
 *                      ici_forall_t representing the statement. The
 *                      fa_index field of ici_forall_t indicates the
 *                      calling sequence. An fa_index of -1 indicating
 *                      the first call.  The function returns 0 to
 *                      indicate it has assigned key/values for an
 *                      iteration, -1 to indicate that iteration
 *                      should end and any other value upon error.
